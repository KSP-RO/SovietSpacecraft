**I HIGHLY reccommend downloading my [Salyut Stations](https://github.com/KSP-RO/SalyutStations) to use with this. It is the sister mod meant to be used with this.**

**I HIGHLY reccommend downloading my [Soviet Rockets](https://github.com/KSP-RO/SovietRockets) to use with this. It is required to launch all of these probes and you need it to use the craft files.**

This pack is a soviet era spacecraft mod that contains the Soyuz 7K-T, 7K-OKA, 7K-OKP 7K-T-AF and Progress 7K-TG, Vostok and Voskhod spacecraft, and TKS/VA spacecraft.

##SOYUZ NOTES:

* This pack now contains the Soyuz 7K-T, 7K-OKA, 7K-LOK, 7K-LK, 7K-OKP, 7K-T-AF and Progress 7K-TG spacecrafts.
* Includes craft files for soyuz launchers included in my soviet probes pack here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88045](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88045)

* PLEASE USE THE INCLUDED CRAFT FILES AS THE SHIPS ARE DIFFICULT TO ASSEMBLE AND MUST BE DONE PROPERLY! THESE FILES INCLUDE ACTION GROUPS


##NOTES:

* This mod is no longer compatible with Bobcat of OLDD protons as I have made my own
* KOSMOS is required for the craft files to load as they contain solar arrays
* You MUST use the Salyut ASAS to properly control the stations!
