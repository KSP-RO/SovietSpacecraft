**I HIGHLY reccommend downloading my [Salyut Stations](https://github.com/KSP-RO/SalyutStations) to use with this. It is the sister mod meant to be used with this.**

**I HIGHLY reccommend downloading my [Soviet Rockets](https://github.com/KSP-RO/SovietRockets) to use with this. It is required to launch all of these probes and you need it to use the craft files.**

This pack is a soviet era spacecraft mod that contains the Soyuz 7K-T, 7K-OKA, 7K-OKP 7K-T-AF and Progress 7K-TG, Vostok and Voskhod spacecraft, and TKS/VA spacecraft.

KOSMOS is a dependency for it's Salyut solar arrays. Before anyone complains that their license forbids redistributing, let me say that I read it VERY carefully. It is a BY NC ND, which means attribution with no derivatives. On the CC page for this it states "Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format" and directly in the parts readme it says "You are permitted to redistribute the parts in their original form, so long as this readme is bundled with them." This means I can redistribute them without making any changes to the original parts as long as I include their original readme and this is what I have done. I tried contacting the original author Normak to confirm this just in case but as many of you know he has been gone a long time and that is not really an option.

##Remotetech Support:
* If you use remotetech, here is a module manager config to make the stations compatible: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/6h8vu19gzxkr413/Salyut_Soyuz_RT.cfg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6h8vu19gzxkr413/Salyut_Soyuz_RT.cfg?dl=0)

##INSTALL:

Unzip into your main KSP folder, overwrite if you have kosmos or module manager already installed.

##SOYUZ NOTES:

* This pack now contains the Soyuz 7K-T, 7K-OKA, 7K-LOK, 7K-LK, 7K-OKP, 7K-T-AF and Progress 7K-TG spacecrafts.
* Includes craft files for soyuz launchers included in my soviet probes pack here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88045](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88045)

* PLEASE USE THE INCLUDED CRAFT FILES AS THE SHIPS ARE DIFFICULT TO ASSEMBLE AND MUST BE DONE PROPERLY! THESE FILES INCLUDE ACTION GROUPS


##NOTES:

* This mod is no longer compatible with Bobcat of OLDD protons as I have made my own
* KOSMOS is required for the craft files to load as they contain solar arrays
* You MUST use the Salyut ASAS to properly control the stations!
